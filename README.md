1. Introduction

The provided code is designed to analyze an IoT Network Intrusion dataset using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to classify network traffic as either normal or an attack based on various network features. This document explains the dataset, the code implementation, and the key methodologies used.

2. Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project contains network traffic data, including multiple features that describe different aspects of network packets. The primary target variable (label) indicates whether a given network activity is normal or malicious. This dataset is essential for training a model to detect cyber threats in IoT environments.

Key Features in the Dataset:

Packet Size & Traffic Rate: Features such as packet size, byte count, and flow duration provide information on the nature of network traffic.

Source & Destination IPs/Ports: Identifies communication patterns between devices.

Protocol & Flag Attributes: Features related to TCP, UDP, ICMP protocols, including SYN, ACK, FIN flags, which help identify suspicious behavior.

Categorical Features: Some columns contain textual data, such as protocol names, which require encoding.

Target Variable: A column indicating whether the traffic is "Normal" or "Intrusion" (attack-related activity).

Class Distribution

The dataset may have an imbalanced class distribution, where the number of normal traffic records is significantly higher than intrusion records.

Imbalanced datasets can impact model performance, requiring resampling techniques such as undersampling or oversampling.

A quick visualization of the class distribution can be achieved with:

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.countplot(x=df['Normal'])
plt.title("Class Distribution of Network Traffic")
plt.show()

Data Preprocessing Considerations

Handling Missing Values:

Some columns might contain missing or null values, requiring imputation or removal.

df.dropna(inplace=True)

Encoding Categorical Features:

Text-based categorical values are converted into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Feature Scaling:

Since network traffic data may have highly varying numerical values (e.g., flow duration vs. packet size), standardization or normalization is applied.

3. Code Breakdown

3.1 Data Loading and Preprocessing

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

The dataset is loaded using pandas.read_csv(), and basic preprocessing steps are applied, such as handling missing values and renaming columns.

df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()
df.dropna(inplace=True)

This ensures that column names do not have extra spaces and that missing values are removed.

3.2 Handling Categorical Data

categorical_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
if categorical_columns.any():
    df = pd.get_dummies(df, drop_first=True)

Categorical columns are identified and converted into numerical representations using one-hot encoding.

3.3 Splitting Data into Features and Labels

X = df.drop(columns=[target_column])
y = df[target_column]

The dataset is divided into features (X) and labels (y).

The target column is determined dynamically to accommodate different dataset structures.

3.4 Train-Test Split and Feature Scaling

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler() to normalize numerical values.

3.5 Model Training using Random Forest

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

A Random Forest Classifier is used to train the model.

The n_estimators parameter is set to 100 for creating multiple decision trees.

3.6 Hyperparameter Tuning

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42), param_grid, cv=3, n_jobs=-1)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

GridSearchCV is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for Random Forest.

This improves model performance by systematically testing different parameter combinations.

3.7 Model Evaluation

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Model Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Classification Report:", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

The model's accuracy is measured.

A classification report is generated to evaluate precision, recall, and F1-score.

Proper data preprocessing ensures better model performance.
